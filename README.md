# 🧠 Open Security Data Lake + Detections-as-Code  
**OCSF + Sigma + Attack Simulation on AWS**

## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to **build a modern, open security data lake** and **operationalize detections-as-code (DaC)** using AWS services, OCSF normalization, and CI/CD pipelines for Sigma-based analytics.  

The lab combines the **AWS re:Inforce 2025 Security Lake workshop** with **community-driven DaC pipelines**, **Sigma rule authoring**, and **attack simulations via Stratus Red Team**—showcasing how to go from *data collection → detection → validation* in a single automated workflow.

## 🏗️ Architecture  



## 🔧 Components  

### **1. Open Security Data Lake (OCSF on AWS)**  
Based on *“AWS re:Inforce 2025 – Operationalizing Amazon Security Lake (hands-on)”*  
- Builds and configures **Amazon Security Lake**  
- Ingests multi-account and multi-region telemetry  
- Normalizes events using **OCSF schema**  
- Queries events with **Athena** or **Jupyter notebooks**  

📂 Folder: `infrastructure/`  
Includes AWS CDK or Terraform templates to provision Security Lake resources.

### **2. Detections-as-Code (DaC)**  
Inspired by *“From Soup to Nuts: Building a Detection-as-Code Pipeline”*  
- **Version-controlled Sigma rules** stored in `/detections/`  
- **CI/CD pipeline** automatically tests, compiles, and validates rules  
- Ensures **consistent quality**, **unit tests**, and **artifact promotion**  

📂 Folder: `detections/`  
Includes YAML Sigma rules + CI pipeline for validation and build automation.

### **3. Sigma Rule Authoring + Validation**  
Based on *“How to Level Up Your SOC Skill with Sigma (compile + import to Splunk)”*  
- Write and compile Sigma rules into target query languages (e.g. SPL, KQL)  
- Validate syntax, mapping, and coverage via unit tests  
- Integrate compiled detections into your SIEM of choice  

📂 Folder: `sigma/`  
Contains rule templates, mappings, and conversion scripts.

### **4. Attack Simulation (Stratus Red Team)**  
Based on *“Reproducing Common Attacks in the Cloud with Stratus Red Team”*  
- Simulates AWS-native attack techniques (e.g., IAM privilege escalation, data exfiltration)  
- Validates detections in real time against Security Lake + DaC pipeline  
- Enables continuous purple-team validation  

📂 Folder: `tests/`  
Includes Stratus Red Team YAML scenarios and validation outputs.

## 🧩 Putting It All Together  

| Stage | Tooling | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Data Collection** | Amazon Security Lake | Centralize & normalize logs |
| **Schema** | OCSF | Standardize telemetry format |
| **Detection Authoring** | Sigma | Create portable rules |
| **Automation** | GitHub Actions / CI | Test and compile detections |
| **Validation** | Stratus Red Team | Simulate attacks & verify coverage |

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Provision Security Lake**  
   - Clone this repo  
   - Deploy infrastructure under `/infrastructure` using CDK or Terraform  
   - Enable sources (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, VPC Flow Logs, etc.)  
2. **Deploy the Detection Pipeline**  
   - Push or modify Sigma rules under `/detections`  
   - CI/CD automatically compiles, validates, and publishes results  
3. **Run Attack Simulations**  
   - Install [Stratus Red Team](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/)  
   - Execute test scenarios from `/tests`  
   - Review detection hits and coverage reports  

## 📊 Example Output  

```bash
$ stratus run aws.iam.enumerate_roles
$ pytest tests/
All 5 detections validated successfully!
```

## 🧩 Future Enhancements  

- Integrate with **AWS Glue + Bedrock for AI-driven detection enrichment**  
- Build coverage dashboards mapping to **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- Add **SOAR integrations** for auto-response workflows
